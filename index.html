    <h1>What is css ?</h1>
    <p>
     <ul>
       <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
       <li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
       <li> CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
       <li> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
     </ul>   
<br>
    </p>
    <h1>History Of CSS</h1>
    <p>
        CSS is another thing you may learn just after understanding HTML. CSS stands for the cascading style sheets, which Hakon Wium Lie created in 1994. Hakon Wium Lie is considered the father of CSS as he created this amazing thing. And he used to work with the father of HTML, Mr. Tim Berners-Lee, when he was working in CERN.
        CSS was offered as the web styling language to make it appealing. And it was the solution that most of the users of HTML were looking at that time. When it launched, the users could use HTML 4.01 and CSS together to make their web pages more attractive.

Alignment of text, positioning and tables were also added. Margin, padding, border and positioning for elements was also implemented. This recommendation was not maintained by W3C.
 
<h3>CSS2</h3>

CSS2 is the improvement of CSS1. It removed the not fully interoperable features. It also included the browser extensions.
